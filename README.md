# TCP_protocol
Creating a TCP protocol from scratch is a complex task that involves implementing various layers and handling low-level networking concepts. It requires a deep understanding of network programming and the TCP/IP stack. However, This is a simplified example of a basic TCP server and client implementation in C.<br>
Please note that this is a simplified implementation, and it may not cover all aspects of the TCP protocol. For a complete and robust TCP implementation, we would typically rely on existing libraries or frameworks.
